# Monochrome Music

## Overview
 
### Objectives

Build a static front-end website for a band or music group. Allow the user to be able to search for the band's commerical tracks and purchase from third-party sites. Create a mailing list and be able to subscribe to a newsletter. Publicise upcoming gigs and availability for bookings and costs. Create links to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. 
 

 ### What does it do?
 
This website allows those interested to interact with the band via a newsletter or availability form and book tickets to gigs (although it is only a front-end site). It offers information about the band and a range of social media links. 
 
### How does it work
 
This website uses Angular JS as a framework and is styled using Bootstrap.
